# Measuring-Openness-to-Trade-
This is the code and data associated with Ravikumar and Waugh (2016) [**Measuring Openness to Trade**](http://www.waugheconomics.com/uploads/2/2/5/6/22563786/measuring_openness.pdf). There are several files. The first file measuring_openness_measure.m loads in data from the Penn World Table (here given as openness_data.xls), then computes the two openness measures that we proposed and then plots Figures (1) and (2) from the paper.  

Future updates will compare the relative openness index and estimates of trade costs. That is figure 3.
